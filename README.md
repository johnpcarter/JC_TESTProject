# Package Name : JC_TESTProject

Can I make changes here, without breaking wm.io commits ???

This is a webMethods package and requires a webMethods Integration Server to host it. Package versioning and configuration can be found in the package [manifest](./JC_TESTProject/manifest.v3) file. Service and API documentation is available on the package's home page http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;packagename>.
